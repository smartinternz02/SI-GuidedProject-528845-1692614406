    <h1>TIME SERIES ANALYSIS FOR BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION</h1>
    
       <p> 
       Bitcoin is the worldâ€™s most valuable cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) and whose network of nodes was started in 2009.
       It is enabled by the blockchain technology and allows for peer-to-peer transactions secured by cryptography.
       Currently, with a market capitalization at around $849.03B (September 2021) and priced at $45,000.00, Bitcoin represents about 66% of the cryptocurrency market, although it is 26.84% below the all time high of $65,000.00 that was reached in May 2021.
       Needless to say 2021 has been a big year for cryptocurrency. Hence, forecasting Bitcoin price has great implications both for investors and traders. </p>
